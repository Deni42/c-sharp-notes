_KeyPress vs. _KeyDown

1. _KeyPress only handler letters and digits, it doesn't handle ctrl, alt, F1, etc.

2. With _KeyDown, the passed parameter has more properties.


Conclusion: _KeyDown gives you more information, but _KeyPress can be useful if you want to know if the pressed character is a digit.
