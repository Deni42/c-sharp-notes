virtual vs abstract methods:

abstract method
	1. child classes MUST define the method body
	2. because of the previous point, it wouldn't be logical to define a body in the base class -> so it is forbidden to have a method body
	3. the class must also have the 'abstract' modifier

virtual method
	1. the base class MUST define the method body
	2. child classes can define the method body, although it isn't necessary
